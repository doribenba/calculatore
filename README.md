Welcome to **Calculatore** a simple command-line calculator (_written in python_) with a unique feature: it understands words as operators. This is my first program and started as a fun experiment to see if I could build a simple calculator.

## How It Works ü™õ

Calculatore performs arithmetic operations using either symbols or words. After each calculation, the result will be used as the starting point for the next calculation unless you type `"reset"`.

### Examples

- `1 plus 3.5`  
  Adds 3.5 to 1, resulting in 4.5.

- `divided by 6`  
  Divides the previous result (4.5) by 6, resulting in 0.75.

### Supported Operators ‚ûñ‚ûï‚ûó

You can use the following operators:

- **Addition**: `plus` or `+`
- **Subtraction**: `minus` or `-`
- **Division**: `divided by` or `/`
- **Multiplication**: `times` or `*`

### Additional Commands ‚åò

- `"reset"`: Resets the calculator to start fresh.
- `CTRL + C`: Exits the program.
- `"man"`: Shows manual of program.

## Installation 

To install this calculator via [Homebrew](https://homebrew.com/), you'll first need to tap the repository:

```bash
brew tap doribenba/calculatore https://github.com/doribenba/calculatore.git
 ```

Then install it:
