Hello World, I made a calculator.

This was a small project to see if I could make a simple calculator, which can take words as operators.
After each calculation the program will add the next operation to the result unless you type "reset"

Examples:

1 plus 3.5

divided by 6

* 3

Operators

plus or +

minus or -

divided by or /

times or *


Additional commands

"reset" to reset

control c to exit
